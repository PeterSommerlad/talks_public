# Vulnerable C++

Slides/Handout for my talk at [CppNorth](https://cppnorth.ca/) 2023 are here.

## Abstract

Programming languages contain features that could cause code to behave badly. Either by creating hazards in safety critical software, or by creating entry points for attacks in security-critical software.

ISO SC22 WG23 working group collects common language vulnerabilities and provides standards that map the common vulnerabilities to specific programming languages and their mitigations.

This talk will give an overview of typical vulnerabilities and will demonstrate examples on how C++ maps to those generic vulnerabilities and how the upcoming standard 24772-10 provides advice for mitigation.
