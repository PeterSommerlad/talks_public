## Safer C++: MISRA-C++ 202x

New MISRA C++ 202x guidelines are coming. This release will address modern C++ 17 and thus is relevant not only for safety critical code in the automotive sector, but also for day-to-day C++ development. Expect the new MISRA rules to be less "miserable" for your day-to-day coding and use static analysis tooling to enforce them. 
The talk briefly introduce the development of safety critical software, highlight some of the modern MISRA C++ rules applicable to all kinds of code and will also show corners of the rule set, better avoided for "normal" C++ code. The latter is important to know, when you are asked to retrofit your code to the output of a static analyzer tuned to MISRA-C++.
